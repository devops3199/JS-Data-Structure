## Graphs
Nodes + Connections
+ are used in social networks (user or recommendation engines)
+ Location / Mapping
+ Routing Algorithms
+ Visual Hierarchy
+ File System Optimizations

### Storing Graphs
+ Adjacency Matrix
    + Takes up more space
    + Slower to iterate over all edges
    + Faster to look up specific edge
+ Adjacency List
    + Can take up less space
    + Faster to iterate over all edges
    + Can be slower to lookup specific edge
